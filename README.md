# NPC Animator
Save and run custom animations on NPCs and on your own character.

Any animation that's in the game can be run on any NPC or on your own player.
However, not all animations run smoothly on each NPC or your own player as they may be designed for another NPC.

All animations are client-side, so they are only visible to you.

Not recommended for using when in combat or doing high risk activities because animated NPC(s) may appear differently in your game client than how the server actually has them.

This plugin is intended to be used to make the NPCs feel more alive and to give them a little extra personality.
It might also be useful if you want to make role-playing videos.

# Features
- Save any animation in the game with your own customizable name for it.
- Run any animation on your own player.
- Run any animation on any NPC.
- Save animations for individual NPCs as 'Greetings'
  - Example: Save the bow animation for King Roald so when you interact with him, he bows to you.
- Run all saved NPC animations at the same time.
  - Use this to run all the saved greeting animations or just 1 specific animation on all saved NPCs.
- Run an animation on all spawned NPCs at the same time.
